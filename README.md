My default  Mutt configuration to work with G Suite / Gmail.

You need to do first this steps:

$ mkdir -p ~/.mutt/cache/headers

$ mkdir -p ~/.mutt/cache/bodies

$ mkdir -p ~/.mutt/certificates

Change the default "user@domain.com" and "mypasswd" with your real settings in the file muttrc, move it to your $HOME directory, rename it to .muttrc and start the Mutt client.

Make the Mail Great Again!!!
